# Domain 1: Cloud Concepts
- 24% of the AWS CLF-C02 exam
- Define the value proposition of AWS Cloud
- Identify design principles of AWS Cloud
- Understand benefits and strategies for migrating existing IT infrastructure to AWS Cloud
- Understand concepts of cloud economics

# Introduction to Cloud Computing

## What is cloud?
- It is actually the Internet !
- global network of connected devices

## The Internet
- Worldwide Network
- Many devices
- Communication
- created and connected using cables

## What is Cloud Computing?
- **On-demand delivery of compute, database storage, application, and other IT resources**
- it lets you access your data anywhere as long as you have an internet connection
- Utilizes a pay-as-you-go model - paying only for what you use or when you use them (provides more flexibility with flexible billing for server usage)
- Most transactions utilize "buy first to use", such as computer or car

### Collaboration with Cloud Computing
- Hold virtual meetings
- Edit documents together
- Communicate with messaging services
- send emails

### Cloud Computing Features
- Instantaneous access
- access resources where and when you want
- More flexible and affordable than legacy IT infrastructure
- Affordable for organizations and individuals with smaller budgets

### Cloud Computing in daily lifes
- emails
- streaming services
- google drive

## Conclusion
Cloud = Internet
Made up of copper wires and global network of billions of devices
- Development of virtualization together with a piece of software called the hypervisor allowed us to think big, pulling together multiple servers and using all of their compute and storage resources together as if we're using one extremely large server
- It is actually like the cloud service providers hosting the mainframe for us, instead of connecting to the mainframe computer  and the data centre at the same floor, we use the internet to connect to the countless servers linked by hypervisors through big service providers like AWS, AZURE, GCP

# Cloud Computing Concepts

## Benefits of Cloud Computing
- you dont have to buy a computer with huge hard disk because you can save file on the cloud using services like Dropbox and these can be accessed by any machines on the internet
- no need for physical servers or cabling
- no need for server room setup and maintenance
- no hardware replacemnet or procurement
- pay on when and what you consume
- scale up or down instantaneously and only pay for what you use
- benefits from economy of scale

## Six Major advantages
1. Trade capital expense for variable expense
2. Benefit from massive enocomies of scale
3. Stop guessing capacity
4. Increase speed and agility
5. Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers
6. Go global in minutes

## AWS Well-Architected Framework
- Allows Organizations to build the most secure, durable, efficient, and high-performing IT infrastructure possible

1. Avoid Unnecessary Cost (Cost Optimization)
    - Use only what you need
    - Reserve resources in advance
    - Continue to monitor for optimization

2. Reliability
    - Test disaster recovery settings
    - Incorporate redundancy
    - Have duplicate copies of resources

3. Efficiency (Performance)
    - The ability to use computing resources to adjust the system requirements
    - it should allow for more experimentation and when a change is set in motion, should be able to global in minutes

4. Security (Infrastructure)
    - Best practices should be automated
    - Data should always be protected
    - Enable traceability
    - Manage access

5. Operational Excellence
    - Document everything
    - Refine operational procedures
    - Anticipate failure
    - Update processes
    - Learn from Failures

If these five practices are taken into account and optimized, you will have a highly-performing, stable IT infrastructure that allow your organization to save money, time and resources
