## What is Cloud Computing?
- **On-demand delivery of compute, database storage, application, and other IT resources**
- it lets you access your data anywhere as long as you have an internet connection
- Utilizes a pay-as-you-go model - paying only for what you use or when you use them (provides more flexibility with flexible billing for server usage)
- Most transactions utilize "buy first to use", such as computer or car

### Collaboration with Cloud Computing
- Hold virtual meetings
- Edit documents together
- Communicate with messaging services
- send emails

### Cloud Computing Features
- Instantaneous access
- access resources where and when you want
- More flexible and affordable than legacy IT infrastructure
- Affordable for organizations and individuals with smaller budgets

### Cloud Computing in daily lifes
- emails
- streaming services
- google drive

## Conclusion
Cloud = Internet
Made up of copper wires and global network of billions of devices
- Development of virtualization together with a piece of software called the hypervisor allowed us to think big, pulling together multiple servers and using all of their compute and storage resources together as if we're using one extremely large server
- It is actually like the cloud service providers hosting the mainframe for us, instead of connecting to the mainframe computer  and the data centre at the same floor, we use the internet to connect to the countless servers linked by hypervisors through big service providers like AWS, AZURE, GCP
